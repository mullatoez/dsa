Binary Search Tree <br >
- A Binary Search Tree is a special form of a binary tree. The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values in its left subtree but less than (or equal to) any values in its right subtree.<br>
- also called an ordered or sorted binary tree. <br >
- Like a normal binary tree, we can traverse a BST in preorder, inorder, postorder or level-order. However, it is noteworthy that inorder traversal in BST will be in ascending order. Therefore, the inorder traversal is the most frequent used traversal method of a BST.<br >

- The time complexity of operations on the binary search tree is directly proportional <br > to the height of the tree.
- Algorithm	Average	Worst case
  - Space	O(n)	O(n)
  - Search	O(log n)	O(n)
  - Insert	O(log n)	O(n)
  - Delete	O(log n)	O(n) <br><br>
